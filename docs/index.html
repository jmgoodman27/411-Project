                <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
                <p>By Jake Goodman</p>
                <p><a class="color-link" href="https://github.com/jmgoodman27/411-Project">See Project on Github</a></p>
                <p><a class="color-link" href="https://ist411.herokuapp.com/">Project Demo</a></p>
                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <p>The project I want to create is a podcasts web app where the user can browse, search, and listen to podcasts online. There are many of these out there, but this one will be based around a social element where the user can save, rate, share, and comment on episodes. For most podcasts, not all episodes are equal in quality and this will help people find the best episodes.</p>
                <h3>Project Design</h3>
                <p>The technologies I will use are <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>, <a href="https://expressjs.com">Express</a>, and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>. For queries I will use <a href="http://knexjs.org">Knex.js</a>, for the view engine I will use <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a>, and for authentication I will use <a href="http://www.passportjs.org">Passport</a>. I will also be using <a href="https://sass-lang.com">Sass</a> for my CSS and <a href="https://gulpjs.com">Gulp.js</a> to handle my builds. Lastly and most importantly, I will be using the <a href="https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/">iTunes Search API</a> to retrieve podcasts in JSON format. This will give me the podcast information along with the RSS feeds which I can then parse with a Node library like <a href="https://github.com/bobby-brennan/rss-parser">rss-parser</a>.</p>
                <p>The projectâ€™s use cases will be to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Search and browse podcasts by name, rating, or genre</li>
                    <li>View list of individual episodes with the ability to save, rate, share, and comment on episodes</li>
                    <li>View list of saved episodes, posted comments, and personal ratings on episodes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There may be additional use cases as the project develops.</p>
                <p>My PostgreSQL database will have the following tables: user, comment, episode. Everything else (most likely) will be retrieved through the iTunes Search API.</p>
                <h3>Project Schedule</h3>
                <p>Checkpoint 1: Technologies listed above are set up along with an established MVC architecture. The user login system is complete with sessions and views including create an account, login, and profile.</p>
                <p>Checkpoint 2: The search view is complete and retrieves podcast data from the iTunes Search API. The podcast view for displaying all episodes within a podcast is complete with the ability to play and save each episode. The friends page is complete with ability to search by username (and save a friend to a list) to see favorited episodes.</p>
                <p>Checkpoint 3: The browse page is complete which brings in data from the iTunes Search API with options to sort by name, rating, and genre. The favorites page is complete which displays saved episodes with the ability to play, comment, and rate each episode directly from this page. When looking up a user from the friends page, these comments and ratings can also be seen. Any revisions and additional functionality will be complete by this checkpoint.</p>
                <p>Final: The final will be everything from checkpoint 3 along with a coat of paint for design. At this point, the web application has been successfully deployed to the server and thoroughly tested for bugs.</p>
                <h3>Project Justification</h3>
                <p>Novelty: My project is different than existing podcast applications because it focuses on a social element that is missing from other podcast apps. There are also not many web applications for podcasts as the bulk are for mobile, which would give people a new medium for discovering podcasts.</p>
                <p>Complexity: This app is plenty complex with all of the technologies I will be using and this project will allow me to gain more experience interacting with an API. I have been really wanting to dive deeper into Node.js and this is the perfect opportunity to do so.</p>
